# Milikan_data_analysis
This code is designed to take in data files from a timer stored in .txt fromat, and run analysis over the physics of drops falling in the presence of gravity and electric fields
Data structure is 

    index     total time    lap time
    index     total time    lap time
 only data to be considered is every other lap time. 
 Need to eventually deal with the error analysis (propigation plus 0.2 human error)
